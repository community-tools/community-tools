# Events Tools

Events tools is an open source app for ambitious event organizers.

The objective of Event Tools is to provide a turnkey solution for organizing & running events, including presentations/cfp, speakers, scheduling, ticketing, website, venue, signage, recording/videos, etc.

The app is intended to scale from meetups to large conferences, and ideally can provide a year-round solution for open source organization and community organizers.

## Installation

Events tools is written in the Elixir language and relies on the Phoenix framework. To start your Phoenix server:

  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
